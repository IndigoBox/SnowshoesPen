# Snowshoes Pen
The default writer app for Project Snowshoes.

# ...Okay, why are you doing <i>this</i> now?

Nearly every platform that wants to be taken seriously in fostering productivity without price recognizes the need for at least basic writing tools that allow for rich content editing. With the type, and quality, of content that we can and are expected to produce rising, it seems illogical to keep scraping by with the same app that just does what it needs to do...be a writer.

<b>That's where we're stepping in.</b>

Pen seeks to encapsulate crisp design, common-sense features and diverse content support to be coupled with a platform that embodies this mission at its core. We have a ton of work to do, and what you see as of this writing is only the very backbone of a project getting started. <b> Therefore, stick around. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1PJvQMq8bBj2SqfqvBDysHCwN5y5eMeU1ptjNC2_ocyA/viewform">Give us a suggestion or two.</a> We hope to have some really exciting features to show you soon.
